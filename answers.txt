1. The browser is as long as the ruler.
2. The divs got smaller by a few lines on the ruler.
3. Both of the divs moved to the right, but div 2 came up first.
4. Both of the divs moved to the left, div 1 came up first.
5. Some of the words get cut off if its small enough.
6. Div 1 and 2 move to opposite ends of the page, Div 1 on right and Div 2 is left, first shown on the page.
7. Div 1 is now in a row above div 2. Div 2 is still in column form and below div 1.
8. The two divs are the same size and next to each other. Div 1 is first.
9. My screen cuts off the words if you go small enough.
10. Copied Div1 to make a Div3.
11. Set the width to 20% to make all three in columns equally sized. They are floated left.
12. I set the width to 35% for div2 and div3 and they all fit on the page.
